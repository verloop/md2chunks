## Introduction
`md2chunks` is a Python project designed for context-enriched markdown chunking, particularly useful for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks. It processes markdown files, splits them into manageable chunks, and enriches them with context to facilitate efficient information retrieval and processing.

## Features
- **Markdown Processing**: Converts markdown files to structured text.
- **Text Splitting**: Splits text into chunks based on token count, with special handling for URLs, decimals, and abbreviations.
- **Context Enrichment**: Adds context to each chunk to maintain the hierarchical structure of the original document.

## Setup

This environment is is setup using UV. Board the UV train, life is easier.

1. [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#uninstallation)
2. Build Virtual Environment: `uv sync`
3. `source .venv/bin/activate`

Note: You can alternatively add the following alias to your .zshrc or .bashrc:
```
alias activate="source .venv/bin/activate"
```
That way, all you have to do is run: 
3. `activate`

## Usage

4. In `src/settings.py` enter your Markdown directory path in `MD_DIR_PATH` and add your markdown files inside it.
5. Create a folder to store processed markdown files (so that original files remain intact) and provide that path in the `PROCESSED_DIR_PATH` inside `src/settings.py`
5. Run `uv python main.py`

Note: `main.py` only returns the chunks to a variable and quits the program. You are free to extend it your usecase.
Incase you want to visualise the chunks, refer to `visualisation.ipynb`. To look at the chunks run the notebook instead of step 5.
